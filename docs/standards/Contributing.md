# Branching

There is only one main branch. Branch off of main and make your changes.

Branch names should make sense and should be in camel case. E.g., `this_is_a_branch_name`

# Merge Requests

All merge requests should have an appropriate title, consisting of a brief description of what was
changed/added. In the description should be a more detailed version, including any and all
important/relevant technical details.

Have at least 1 approval.

# Unit Tests

We want a coverage of at least 80%.
